			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/jn_bb2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1314" title="jn_bb2" src="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/jn_bb2.jpg?w=500&#038;h=255" alt="" width="500" height="255" /></a></p>
<p>May you live in interesting times! This is an old Chinese curse, although some mistakenly attribute it a blessing. Interesting times are of course, times of change, times of upheaval, times where the old and sedate ways of the world are undergoing transformation. They are, quite simply, Uranus-Pluto times. We live in such times.</p>
<p>As a standard-bearer for the Uranus-Pluto in Virgo generation of the late 1960s, I am under no illusions about what it might mean. It means that now, as Pluto squares Uranus for the first time since Hitler rose to the office of Chancellor &#8211; indeed, he was sworn into that sacred office exactly at the critical median pass of the Uranus-Pluto squares of the 1930s &#8211; we are likely to experience interesting times ahead. Every grating clash of these distant behemoths tells a similar story, whether it be the Norman conquest of the 11th Century, the Black Death in Europe, or indeed the rise of Fascism, these contacts, in the 4th harmonic at least, seem to encapsulate a time of darkness. The greatest pressure will fall therefore on those born in the late 1960s and early 1970s who have been serving their apprenticeship in handling these vast and unstable cosmic energies and whose lives to date have involved a remarkable training in uncertainty principles!</p>
<p>We all crave a life characterised by stability, by predictability, by <em>safety</em>, but the Uranus &#8211; Pluto adepts of the 60s are the generation that safety forgot. They have found themselves assuming the helm of a society that looks ahead and can see only darkness, and all the predictions are gloomy, shadows beset every horizon and we can take nothing for granted. To be born between 1963 and 1971 is in many ways a curse, but there is little point in feeling cursed, you were born to be forged in the crucible of Hades and remade through the power of uncertainty, into a magician. As I speak, people write to me and tell me how they are waking up to a new reality, and how the old reality is not so much redundant as it is laughable. Of course a few people write to me and tell me that I&#8217;m an idiot too, but that&#8217;s normal. If you believe it, then it&#8217;s true, right?</p>
<p>So, we were not born to be safe, we were born to <em>handle it</em>. Some of us are still struggling with the injustice of having to handle it, but there we are. All unhappiness stems from not wanting what is, and that means that one only has to choose to be happy. It&#8217;s the work of a moment to be happy, not a lifetime. But if you&#8217;re unhappy then it&#8217;s because somebody out there thinks you deserve to be, and you believe them. That doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to endure narcissists and bullies, only that you can choose not to believe in them, and then they can&#8217;t stop you being happy any longer. Uranus &#8211; Pluto: sudden insight into the source of the control issues in your life.</p>
<p>So, there&#8217;s no point feeling hard done by, or worrying about impending doom. The worst that can happen to you is that you&#8217;ll die, and that&#8217;s no big deal. If you&#8217;re a magician it&#8217;s your work to change reality, to change the world through the medium of magical intention. What&#8217;s stopping you? I know what&#8217;s stopping you, it&#8217;s all the haters, the mockers, the sneering hordes, the people who tell you that you&#8217;re a fool and that you&#8217;re never going to amount to a thing. So what does it matter if you don&#8217;t, so long as you operate from a place of spiritual intention and integrity.</p>
<p>Nothing else matters.</p>
<p>If you can accept that, then you&#8217;re in a good position, because any day now, you are going to be able to step it up. It&#8217;s not easy to do this work because the ego gets in the way &#8211; not just your ego either &#8211; and you have to stay on course. People with spiritual intentions always appear to be simpletons to people without them.</p>
<p>On October 28th we enter the Age of the Fifth Sun. There&#8217;s some argument around the exact date of course, but there always is, it&#8217;s only those people who think that you&#8217;re an idiot who care about the &#8216;exact&#8217; date. It&#8217;s close enough. The Age of the 5th Sun is accelerating the frequency of human consciousness, but it only works on those who have adopted spiritual integrity. Spiritual integrity is a meaningless concept, of course, to those that don&#8217;t have it. Imagine that it&#8217;s like getting an upgrade on your TV to high-definition: it doesn&#8217;t make any difference to the blind.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to talk about astrology in this context because we&#8217;re talking about Galactic astrology, not Solar. The Galactic Centre is just one piece of the puzzle. Did you know that William Lilly believed that the Moon could never go void of course in Sagittarius, but he could never understand why? I think that with precession, the GC is about to move into 27 Sagittarius, a critical degree, trining the astrologer&#8217;s degree at 27 Leo. Last night I dreamt that 10 Capricorn was an all-important degree too, that it had weight and I felt it that way. Like one of those Einsteinian models of space-time where a weight is placed upon a rubber sheet, distorting the continuum. I have not made an investigation of that yet.</p>
<p>Uranus-Pluto concepts are &#8216;out-there&#8217; in all the myriad understandings of that phrase, and the magical act herein is to personalise that weird and dangerous energy; to bring it into the personal sphere. That process is begun by no longer being at the mercy of the energy; the instability of your life is not your fault, but neither should you feel like the victim of it (and chances are you have the Neptune-Pluto sextile in the mix too). In which area of your life, your chart are you having to take control of the instabilities of your life? Where are you required to communicate the falsity of the  myths that have grown up around your reality. The time has come to break them apart, to break free, to challenge the shadow that threatens your world. As the forces of evil, narcissists and haters all, attempt to smother your truth and humiliate you into silence (negative Plutonians always peddle judgment and humiliation) be like the sky, rise above it all and let your truth shine.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re rare and remarkable and you have earned the right to be you.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here&#8217;s a new audio discussion, this time on the subject of the 8th house, for which I receive many requests for more analysis. The discussion lasts for a little over an hour, and covers considerable ground, with a focus on the general conditions of the 8th house, the probable manner of death, how Gemini and Mercury operate as examples, some thoughts on Mars in the 8th and several example charts all of which can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/chirotic_8thcharts.pdf" target="_blank">Chart examples include River Phoenix, Henri de Tolouse-Lautrec, Florence Griffith-Joyner (Flo-Jo), Indira Gandhi and George Harrison</a>.</p>
<p>Many topics are covered, not limited to the 8th house, so there should be something for everyone. There were a couple of recording &#8216;issues&#8217; so the quality is (very occasionally) uneven, and it ends a little abruptly, however, I hope that it is still engaging and informative enough for a very discerning audience. At approximately 10 and half minutes in I make the erroneous statement that River Phoenix has Mercury in Gemini in the 7th, in fact I meant to say Moon in Gemini in the 7th, and hopefully that will be clear from the remainder of the discussion.</p>
<p>Please do email your questions for the next podcast to me and I&#8217;ll do my best to address as many as I am able, jeremy@astrologyhour.com.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another day, another discussion. Continuing from where I left off last time, today I discuss Orcus as a key component of spiritual integrity and the implications this has for finding meaning within your own life. I have listened to the constructive comments and emails I have received from many kind people and tried to adjust my &#8216;style&#8217; accordingly, thus, this episode is a little faster paced. I&#8217;m also keen to bring in some wider astrological observations in the future, so in this episode we will be focusing on some of the foundation concepts of spiritual awareness. As we discussed last time around, astrology is really not very effective unless applied within a spiritual framework.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also compressed the file somewhat, without hopefully compromising the quality. The discussion lasts for 42 minutes and the file is 38mb in size.</p>
<span style='text-align:left;display:block;'><p><object type='application/x-shockwave-flash' data='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' width='290' height='24' id='audioplayer1'><param name='movie' value='http://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/audio-player/player.swf' /><param name='FlashVars' value='&amp;bg=0xf8f8f8&amp;leftbg=0xeeeeee&amp;lefticon=0x666666&amp;rightbg=0xcccccc&amp;rightbghover=0x999999&amp;righticon=0x666666&amp;righticonhover=0xffffff&amp;text=0x666666&amp;slider=0x666666&amp;track=0xFFFFFF&amp;border=0x666666&amp;loader=0x9FFFB8&amp;soundFile=http%3A%2F%2Fchirotic.files.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F07%2F110713.mp3' /><param name='quality' value='high' /><param name='menu' value='false' /><param name='bgcolor' value='#FFFFFF' /><param name='wmode' value='opaque' /></object></p></span>
<p>As ever, if you would rather download the file so that you can listen while you&#8217;re in your car, going for a run, or rounding Cape Horn in your bathtub, then <a href="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/110713.mp3">you can find it here</a>&#8230;</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday I took the momentous step of recording the first of a series of discussions on various astrological theories and concepts. As an experiment I am going to make the first part available here while I determine the best means of sharing the material with you all. Any thoughts, considered strategies or feedback is most welcome.</p>
<p>For the first discussion, I recorded the material while out walking Juno. I had no material prepared, and the sound quality was perhaps less than optimum because of the blustery weather and the fact that I was walking at the time. I am excited by the possibility of recording a more considered discussion in future rather than this completely off-the-cuff ramble!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My book on Orcus is nearing completion and I have to say it&#8217;s been a really incredible journey, I am so very much looking forward to sharing this important discovery and its many insights with the astrological community. I have no hesitation in proclaiming my belief that Orcus is not a minor planet, indeed, I am firmly of the view that he is indeed as important as Pluto, albeit with a more impersonal focus. I realise that this is a bold claim, but in the many hundreds of nativities I have studied in my research for the book, there is no question that many fundamental aspects of character and life-orientation could simply have not been properly understood without the inclusion of Orcan principles. Indeed in many cases, the nativity is simply undecipherable without it; it is an understanding to astrology not unlike the Rosetta Stone was to Egyptology. I hope it does not come across as altogether too bold to say that some of the conclusions that I have arrived at are so startling that they will undoubtedly revolutionise the study of astrology, in much the same way as the evidence of Pluto did in the latter part of the 20th Century.</p>
<p>Of course, the writing of a work such as this has altered my priorities a great deal. I have struggled especially to keep up with correspondence (an occupational hazard at the best of times for a professional astrologer), and this journal has suffered most of all. I look forward to the day (in the not too distant future) when the book is published and I can get back to writing articles on this journal with greater regularity.</p>
<p>In order to minimise some of the fallout from the change in priorities I have created a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Chirotic-Journal/206431722732416">Facebook page for this journal</a> where I will be writing daily updates and insights and I hope to be able to communicate more directly with everyone. I would be delighted to see you there.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/mosesheston2703_468x611.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1255" title="mosesHeston2703_468x611" src="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/mosesheston2703_468x611.jpg?w=468&#038;h=611" alt="" width="468" height="611" /></a></p>
<p>Hermeneutics is the study of spiritual thought, usually through literature, as an integral facet of the search for meaning. We all search for meaning, although we invariably look for it in different places: for some our car gives life meaning, for others their job does the trick and for a few, meaning is found within a spiritual, rather than a material context. All meaning is subjective; reality for you cannot be the same as reality for me, because we each interpret experience according to our own unique perspectives, which means, very simply, that nobody is wrong.</p>
<p>It took me many years to work this out. When the realisation finally broke upon my consciousness, very recently in fact, it was both liberating and shocking. Liberating because in releasing others from the burden of my subjective expectations, I also released myself. And shocking because I came to understand how much energy I have wasted in my life as a result. Strange (and good) things have begun to happen to me, emotionally, mentally and physiologically.</p>
<p>I create all resistance. If my neighbour decides to mow his lawn at 7:30 am, as he did this very morning, the problem has nothing to do with his mowing the lawn, and everything to do with my expectation that he should be more considerate on a weekend. In that situation I could respond in one of two ways: I could either apply pressure on him to mow his lawn later in the day, or I could decide not to have a problem with him mowing his lawn at 7:30 am. The problem arises of course when I have made a rule. My rule might say that &#8216;people should not make excessive noise on the weekend before 9 am&#8217;, and all might be well in my life provided nobody breaks my rule. In a world which contains inhabitants with a different rule: one which says people &#8216;should not make excessive noise on the weekend before 7:30 am&#8217; there is the potential for conflict.</p>
<p>Clearly this is a rule designed to make sense of the physical world and yet its existence contains a seed of disharmony. Were I to enforce my rule then I am quite sure that relations with my neighbour would deteriorate rapidly, because, what with all experience being subjective, we would both be right: and no compromise would be reasonable for either party. If a compromise were reached it would undoubtedly feature at least a modicum of resentment.</p>
<p>And while that&#8217;s only a potential, it is nonetheless a potential actualising from grass-mowing.</p>
<p>Hermeneutics is derived from Hermes, thus Mercury and comes from the Greek <em>hermeneuō</em>, meaning to interpret or translate, and in keeping with Mercury, it is within the derivation of <em>meaning</em> from what is said, that the potential for difficulty arises. Mercury was after all a trickster as much as a communicator. What is meant has almost no bearing upon what is understood.</p>
<p>This is really intriguing because if we accept that all understanding is subjective then we can posit the amazing understanding that no two people can understand the same reality. Scientists will argue, but increasingly the field of quantum study suggests that the Heisenberg principle is distinctly more far-reaching than even Werner Heisenberg himself suspected. Observation alters reality at the quantum level, therefore subjectivity affects reality in the most profound manner imaginable, since observation is intrinsically subjective. Objectivity is bunkum.</p>
<p>Therefore, hermeneutic results are only good for the one engaged in the study. So, I study my life in a spiritual context to elicit meaning and I can share that experience. Indeed, it is what I do every day in conversation, correspondence and in my work, and that is all to the good. Problems can only arise therefore when I create rules. Rules which are absolutely accurate and valid for me cannot, for quantum reasons, be accurate and valid for anybody else, and this applies to grass-mowing as much as to spiritual context. Objectivity is rule-making and therefore senseless.</p>
<p>Okay, so you can argue. You might say that surely it&#8217;s objectively correct that you should never physically assault another person. Here there is a confusion of content with context, which is the classic flaw of objectivity. The content (assaulting others) is only inappropriate in context: (e.g. while shopping for groceries). In another context assaulting somebody may be <em>entirely</em> appropriate (if they are threatening to kill your children for example). The realisation therefore is that objectivity cannot exist and this is true for everything of course.</p>
<p>Every problem in the world would resolve itself overnight if everybody realised this truth.</p>
<p>Hermeneutics, which found its natural home among countless Catholic scholars from the Middle Ages on, and to this day informs fundamentalists and moderates alike of various faiths, is enormously limiting to social harmony. If all interpretation is subjective, then interpreting objective truth is a failure of perspective, even if subjectively the interpreter cannot be wrong. <em>Religion</em> is the transformation of subjective spiritual truth into objective rules. While there may be a consensus among scholars, the law of attraction ensures that those of a like-mind collaborate, minimising the need for compromise. If my neighbour believed that mowing the lawn should never happen before 9 am, our conflict potential would be greatly minimised.</p>
<p>So where&#8217;s the problem? The same insight applies in reverse. There ought to be no problem with religion, since if that&#8217;s what a person chooses to believe then that&#8217;s only their reality, right? The problem with religion is that it seeks to quarantine personal hermeneutics and exalt one person&#8217;s interpretation over another&#8217;s. The priest who proclaims God&#8217;s message is denying another human being&#8217;s freedom to subjectively interpret their reality. When we deny others the right to choose their leaders, we call it totalitarianism. Defining spiritual truth in commandments, rules or judgements &#8211; <em>and denouncing others for not following them</em> &#8211; is spiritual abuse. Living by them privately is your choice and how wonderful that you have interpreted spiritual truth within the context of that consensus. If that is your choice, I respect your choice, because what you believe is absolutely, marvellously, beautifully perfect.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/future.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1247" title="future" src="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/05/future.jpg?w=480&#038;h=320" alt="" width="480" height="320" /></a></p>
<p>I think one of the great uncharted territories of astrology lies in the arena of prediction. It&#8217;s probably foolhardy, as an astrologer to even try, but we all fall for it from time to time, on any map of useful astrological employments, prediction ought to be accompanied by appropriate warning: &#8220;here be dragons&#8221; or somesuch. As it happens I have discovered a very powerful means of predicting the future, but even though it is astounding, it is also, without question a little like looking at the future as though it were a narrowly possible present. It resembles a distorted image, as though the lens of viewing were dark, uncertain and dim. Very often, the image we arrive at is rather like a jigsaw puzzle before assembly; once the future falls into the present we understand what we are looking at and how all those pieces fit together, and it makes complete sense; every piece is utilised and adds to the overall picture. Where then is the use? Well, I believe that even knowing the pieces is enough to give us clues about the general tone or theme of the big picture. When I look at those jigsaw pieces and discern a bright spray of hydrangeas, patches of thatch and blue sky, and dark glints of leaded glass, I can guess that the overall picture is of an ancient English country cottage, and the same is true enough for astrology. I can predict that somebody I know will become very sick this year, that somebody I love will die next year, and that too, for many people I know, the more things change, the more they will stay the same, and I can know all of this <em>regardless</em> of how the reality transpires once the future is realised.</p>
<p>It might seem strange, but this is not illogical. The art of prediction can never be an exact science, and while to a very great extent the exactitude of the future sketch &#8211; it cannot be more than impressionistic &#8211; is dependent upon the skill of the practitioner, even the most skilled cannot ever create a precise image of days to come.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this is precisely because we do not have fate. Very few aspects of human life are set in stone. It appears to be true that our lifespan is fixed, the day we are born we are fixed into a specific timescale, which can be likened to a movie before we have watched it. We can read the back cover and discern the movie&#8217;s genre and broad themes, we can take note of its running time, and perhaps we can understand some of the characters that will be involved in driving the plot, but we cannot know the plot, nor can we understand how the movie will end.</p>
<p>We can make some generalisations. Generally, the purpose of a human life is to raise consciousness, but unless you are committed to that goal you will not manage anything but the most meagre of gains. The great trick of the world is to make that objective antithetic to reason. The obvious statements of human society are at odds with spiritual perspectives. But that is as it should be, because spiritual progress is synonymous with struggle. Spiritual collapse is too, but that&#8217;s a story for another day, the quality of character is everything in this world. For me these are undeniable truths that make me foolish and misguided in the eyes of the many, but which leave me no alternative but to pursue this difficult path to self-realisation. Anything else is just &#8211; <em>at best</em> &#8211; treading water, and how better can one define time-wasting, energy-wasting? What is astrology? Is it a map of your potential or is it the blueprint of your prison? Until we understand our true nature, we are all in solitary confinement. A little like the Buddhist who understands that to reach Nirvana we have to let go of pleasure as well as pain, we can see that we have to transcend our trines as well as our oppositions and squares, and that, of course, is very much harder to do.</p>
<p>I love the phrase &#8220;at odds with yourself.&#8221; I find that it describes so well the great conundrum of human life, and the gift of astrology. Society creates enormous pressure to subscribe to linear reality because:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&#8217;s all there is.</li>
<li>Anything else is therefore madness and,</li>
<li>This is proven by the fact that there is no evidence that anything else works, therefore it&#8217;s all there is.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s a neat and circular system that leaves us devoid of options. You have to believe against all common-sense that a non-linear perspective is viable and make a leap of faith. Incidentally, nobody who ever made a <em>genuine</em> leap of faith regretted it, not once. So there is subjective evidence that it works, but that evidence is by design, immaterial. That&#8217;s the trap of course, moving beyond the material creates a dearth of (material) <em>evidence</em>.</p>
<p>So, while your future is within your astrology, with stunning precision, every detail mapped, we cannot without hindsight put it together in perfection. The evidence for the future is immaterial. It&#8217;s easy to understand why.</p>
<p>Most astrologers know that Pluto is often indicative of grandmothers. Nobody really understands why unless we put together the rulers of the 4th and 5th houses. Here then we have a concepts of <em>generations</em>, where we put together mothers and their children. If the 4th is your mother (in the lunar correspondence) then the 5th of the 4th is your mother as somebody&#8217;s child. The 4th of the 5th is the 8th, ruled by Pluto.</p>
<p>If you have Mars on the descendant, squaring Saturn in the 10th then you might deduce that since the 10th is the 4th of the 7th, the placement will likely manifest through the partner&#8217;s family. Alone, the 10th is the house that concerns itself with status, the 7th house alone is the partner, so with these two planets here there will be destructive and oppressive (Ma vs Sa) in-laws who are strongly status-driven; the native will find themselves drawn toward romantic relationships with people who have &#8216;difficult&#8217; families. By the same token, the 7th is the 2nd of the 6th, which suggests that one would have to work quite hard for money. Now, you might think it&#8217;s the same for everyone, after all, who <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> have to work hard for money, but it&#8217;s not: a well aspected and strong Jupiter in the 7th is often indicative of somebody who comes into money easily, especially through marriage (see how it all adds up?) Both realities are honoured. The 10th is the 2nd of the 9th too, so here are philosophical, religious and civic values, and money earned from them. The 10th is also the 12th of the 11th, so it represents sorrow from friends, friends that are in truth enemies (the 12th is the house of secret enemies, the 7th of open enemies), or perhaps your alcoholic or addicted friends too, as well as those friends you make &#8216;down the pub.&#8217; By the same token, the 10th is the 11th of the 12th too, so it represents your spiritual aspirations, charitable groups you might belong to and medical technology. As you can see, the range of possibility is vast, and while astrology tends toward clarity, as you become more and more self-aware, you begin to close off the channels of compulsive manifestation and the Universe has to get quite creative to find new combinations of derivative houses through which to manifest unowned energy blocks into your external reality. If you work with houses in this way, you can account for everything in creation. What is your car? Is it a pure 3rd house energy: something which gets you around within your local environment, or is it a 12th house manifestation: 10th of the 3rd, a status symbol encapsulated in a vehicle: no wonder that falls in the 12th house! You&#8217;re never going to be satisfied by that are you? Not for long anyway, no surprise that&#8217;s a Neptunian energy signature, and Pisces and Neptune often seem to give a great craving for &#8216;dream cars&#8217;.</p>
<p>This myriad array of potentials of course is what makes astrology &#8216;theoretically&#8217; impossible, or at best, unwieldy. Fortunately we can see how astrology gets applied using various techniques &#8211; many of which have nothing much to do with astrology &#8211; and create a retrospective form of real-world astrology that is tailored to the individual. Anyone who claims they can look at your astrology without knowing the first thing about your life and tell you they know what makes you tick is lying. They can tell you only what is <em>more likely</em> to make you tick. Astrology can make educated guesses and very often they&#8217;ll pay off, but not always.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve discovered something new however: a process of determining what makes a human being tick. It&#8217;s remarkable, eloquent and powerfully effective, very soon I will be making that information available, once I have structured it in such a way that it can be transmitted accurately. We astrologers are always trying to balance these two opposing energies: the need for precision and operating with a usable narrowness of focus with the complexity and infinite possibility of astrology&#8217;s descriptive language. It&#8217;s extremely skilled work, and even with the evidence of a life at one&#8217;s disposal it&#8217;s difficult, so the future adds another veil over the scene that is being explored, but things change, new discoveries are made, new methods are revealed and we move confidently into a future where astrology becomes that which it is: &#8211; undeniable.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/whale.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1241" title="whale" src="http://chirotic.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/whale.jpg?w=450&#038;h=269" alt="" width="450" height="269" /></a></p>
<p>I feel that, despite the self-evident craziness of what I am about to write that I need to get it out there. Think what you will. I have been having incredible dreams of late, and last night I experienced the most remarkable dream of my life. It was astonishing in its depth and immediacy in a way that no other dream I&#8217;ve had has been. I would hesitate to call it a dream in fact, because my apprehension of qualities within the dream were beyond my normal experience, it is very difficult to explain with words. I wasn&#8217;t entirely asleep, but rather in a kind of meditative trance because I had some vague awareness of my surroundings and a sense of my own sleeping body.</p>
<p>I was floating in space and I could see the earth beneath me and as I looked around I could see whales. Blue whales. They were not the same as the blue whales that you see in the ocean because they were made entirely of a sort of light. I cannot say that it <em>was</em> light, because it had a texture as well, almost like a kind of clingfilm, but it glowed with ripples of colour, and I cannot describe the depth of that colour. it was a textured, coloured light substance, but that does not convey its richness and perfection.</p>
<p>The whales were floating all around and they were very comforting to be near. They were communicating with counterpart whales in the oceans of earth. This communication took the form of a beam of information which comprised a bright stream filled with symbols, geometric, like an alphabet but, and again there is no easy way to describe this, the symbols were accompanied by a feeling of warmth and kindness. They were transmitted with a sense of lovingness.</p>
<p>I realised (by which I mean I just &#8216;knew&#8217; this in my dream) that the whales of the earth&#8217;s oceans were somehow copies of these light-whales, that they were very crude representations but they were the best that could be made with the rather inelegant systems of the earth, and that they were deliberately manifested physical representatives of the whales above the earth. But they were clumsy, and heavy, so infinitely heavy, when compared to their space-counterparts, but it was the best the space-whales could create with the materials at their disposal. I sensed too that there was a direct correlation between humankind&#8217;s attitude to whale-killings and spiritual level. I felt with a real urgency the deep wrongness of the killing of whales and that it doomed us as a species to not becoming aware of this other dimension of experience which was all around us and that was permeated with love and kindness. All this while I stayed aware, albeit distantly, of my body which was so relaxed and I realised that I lived every day with deep tension in me and that it was so easy to let go of it in this state. Most of all I understood that something was happening, that some kind of a peak was close, a watershed moment. The whales had a sense of excitement and anticipation as though they had finally poured enough of this love-data down into the earth, via the conduits of the clumsy earth-whales, which were still in themselves creatures of love and grace, but nothing in comparison to their space-brethren.</p>
<p>When I &#8216;woke up&#8217; I felt humbled and peaceful, and I haven&#8217;t been able to shake that sense of excited anticipation either. I just know something is happening&#8230;</p>
